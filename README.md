# Rank
AgenticAI_WebRanking is a Flask-based SEO rank tracker that scrapes Google search results to monitor how keywords rank over time, and then uses Microsoft's Phi-3 LLM via Ollama to analyze ranking trends. It supports both single and batch keyword searches, storing results in CSV format and visualizing ranking history using Chart.js. The backend integrates Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and pandas for scraping and data handling, while the frontend leverages HTML, Select2, and interactive charts. It also features robust error handling, CSV-based data storage, and insightful analysis on title shifts and URL changes. This makes it a powerful tool for anyone looking to track and understand SEO performance through AI-powered insights.
